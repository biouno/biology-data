[Website](http://www.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/distruct.html)

distruct is a program that can be used to graphically display results produced by the genetic clustering program structure or by other similar programs. The figures produced by distruct display individual membership coefficients in the same form as used in "Genetic structure of human populations" Science 298: 2381-2385 (2002). Various options enable the user to control left-to-right printing order of populations, bottom-to-top printing order of clusers, colors, and other graphical details.
